I am he<br>
As you are he<br>
As you are me<br>
And we are all together<br>
<br>
See how they run<br>
Like pigs from a gun<br>
See how they fly<br>
I'm crying<br>
<br>
Sitting on a cornflake<br>
Waiting for the van to come<br>
Corporation tee shirt<br>
Stupid bloody Tuesday<br>
Man, you been a naughty bo<br>
You let your face grow long<br>
<br>
I am the eggman<br>
They are the eggmen<br>
I am the walrus<br>
Goo goo g' joob<br>
<br>
Mister city p'liceman sitting pretty<br>
Little p'licemen in a row<br>
See how they fly<br>
Like Lucy in the sky<br>
See how they run<br>
I'm crying<br>
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying<br>
<br>
Yellow matter custard<br>
Dripping from a dead dog's eye<br>
Crabalocker fishwife pornographic priestess<br>
Boy you been a naughty girl<br>
You let your knickers down<br>
<br>
I am the eggman<br>
They are the eggmen<br>
I am the walrus<br>
Goo goo g' joob<br>
<br>
Sitting in an English<br>
Garden waiting for the sun<br>
If the sun don't come<br>
You get a tan from standing in the English rain<br>
<br>
I am the eggman<br>
They are the eggmen<br>
I am the walrus<br>
Goo goo g' joob g' goo goo g' joob<br>
<br>
Expert texpert choking smokers<br>
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?<br>
See how they smile<br>
Like pigs in a sty, see how they snied<br>
I'm crying<br>
<br>
Semolina pilchards<br>
Climbing up the Eiffel Tower<br>
Element'ry penguin singing Hare Krishna<br>
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe<br>
<br>
I am the eggman<br>
They are the eggmen<br>
I am the walrus<br>
Goo goo g' joob<br>
Goo goo g' joob<br>
G' goo goo g' joob<br>
Goo goo g' joob, goo goo g' goo g' goo goo g' joob joob...
